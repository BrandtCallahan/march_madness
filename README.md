# March Madness


### Set Up:
The .csv files are built in a folder heirarchy that will need to either be mimicked or changed when you run the code. The currect folder heirarchy:

f"~/Documents/Python/professional_portfolio/march_madness/..."

This is the base directory (starting point) for this entire repo.
